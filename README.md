# CPB-LiDAR
A virtual pipeline to study sensitivity of UAV-like LiDAR metrics to plant parameters using structural modeling and machine learning :

This project use CPlantBox (2022 release) to generate virtual fields, from which artificial LiDAR metrics are extracted. 
Next, the relations between such artificial LiDAR metrics and plant parameters can be investigated.

Installation : 
- CPlantBox : 2022 release (DOI : 10.5281/zenodo.6953939). Follow instructions in CPlantBox repository.
- Drop the folder of this project (CPB-LiDAR) into CPlantBox-master/CPB/CPlantBox/
